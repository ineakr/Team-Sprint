            <h2> The client</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Client name: Team Sprint</li>
                <li> Contact persons: Arne Skuterud & Carina Jagtøyen </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our client, Team Sprint, is a team of four Norwegian speed skaters. We were 
                introduced to this client by Carina, who is one of the speed skaters in Team Sprint. 
                As the name of the team implies, the four athletes specialize in the sprint distances 
                of speed skating, which are 100, 500 and 1000 meters.
                Team Sprint has a close cooperation with the Norwegian Skating 
                Federation and the Norwegian National Sprint Team. Their goal is to provide
                sprinters that find themselves on the second highest level with the opportunity to 
                develop and climb the last few steps up to the highest level of sprint in Norway. Team 
                Sprint depends on the support from sponsors and this website will be used as a resource 
                for reaching out to potential sponsors and promoting their current sponsors. We will
                create a website called Team Sprint Skøyter.

            <h2> Purpose and goals</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the Norwegian tradition of long-distance speed skating, 
                Team Sprint seeks to educate and inspire Norwegian coaches and young speed 
                skaters into wanting to specialize in sprint. Our goal to fulfill this 
                purpose is to create a platform for Team Sprint to share their knowledge 
                about sprint training, in the form of training programs, exercises and thoughts 
                about sprint technique. In other words, we need to provide users with 
                the opportunity to watch videos of the various exercises that are mentioned 
                in the training programs. Another goal, to fulfill the purpose of inspiring, 
                is to give a short introduction of each athlete, a description of Team Sprint´s 
                work and goals and provide updates from competitions and training camps.
            </p>

            <h2> Audience</h2>
            <p> The main audience of this website will be coaches and athletes from 
                different speed skating clubs and teams in Norway. This group will 
                use the website to learn about sprint technique and to find inspiration 
                in exercises that contribute to improve the attributes that are essential 
                for sprint on ice. The audience also consists of those who are interested 
                in following the journey and results of the Team Sprint athletes.
