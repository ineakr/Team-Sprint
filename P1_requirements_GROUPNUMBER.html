        <h2> The client</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Client name: Team Sprint</li>
            <li> Contact person: Arne Skuterud & Carina Jagtøyen </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our client, Team Sprint, is a team of four Norwegian speed skaters. We were 
            introduced to this client by Carina, who is one of the speed skaters in Team Sprint. 
            As the name of the team implies, the four athletes specialize in the sprint distances 
            of speed skating, which are 100, 500 and 1000 meters.
        </p>

        <h2> Purpose and goals</h2>
        <p>
            Because of the Norwegian tradition of long-distance speed skating, 
            Team Sprint seeks to educate and inspire Norwegian coaches and young speed 
            skaters into wanting to specialize in sprint. Our goal to fulfill this 
            purpose is to create a platform for Team Sprint to share their knowledge 
            about sprint training, in the form of training programs, exercises and thoughts 
            about sprint technique. In other words, we need to provide users with 
            the opportunity to watch videos of the various exercises that are mentioned 
            in the training programs. Another goal, to fulfill the purpose of inspiring, 
            is to give a short introduction of each athlete, a description of Team Sprint´s 
            work and goals and provide updates from competitions and training camps.
        </p>

        <h2> Audience</h2>
